An interstellar game. Make your way through randomly genrated planets and build there your home.
## About
This game is not developed (for now). We're waiting Godot 4.0 with a better 3D render engine to make the game graphically better. Also this is a HUGE project and we prefer making some xp with BigFlatPanda in scripting. We *might* continue the game when we'll finish BFP.
